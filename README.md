# Information
Some functions (including those that will appear in the future) have not been tested and will not be available for use by every user. The fact is that only users who have received a login and password from the Hilarious administration for server applications have access to some requests in HilAPI. If you have such data, enter it in the application settings (settings.ini), in the login and password parameters. Naturally, this data will not be transferred anywhere, you can verify this in the source code.
